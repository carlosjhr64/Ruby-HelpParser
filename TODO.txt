== TODO

"silentyly" automate -V --verbose to mean $VERBOSE==true
Allow user override? That is, if user defines -V and --verbose, don't do $VERBOSE=true


When a type check fails, drop to next usage.

== Done

On a typo of a option name, it currently just gives "Please match usage."
But should give the unrecognize name.
